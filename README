Tie/Alias version 0.01
======================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This module provides LEXICAL aliases for scalars. 

To get Tie::Alias
to provide aliases for arrays and
for hashes, obtain Tie::Alias::Hash and Tie::Alias::Array.
Support for Tie::Alias::Handle is written into Tie::Alias
but all it does at this time is croak and suggest using
bourne-shell style duplicate opening instead.
